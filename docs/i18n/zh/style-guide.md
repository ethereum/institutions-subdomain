# Chinese (Simplified) Translation Style Guide
## Ethereum Foundation — Institutional Website

---

## Voice & Register

**Target register:** Authoritative, confident, professional. Think McKinsey report or Goldman Sachs whitepaper — not crypto Twitter, not marketing hype.

The English source copy is already assertive institutional marketing. The Chinese should match that energy without amplifying it. Let the data and claims speak for themselves.

**Reference tone:** 财新 (Caixin), 麦肯锡中文报告, 高盛研究报告

## Core Rules

### 1. No Editorializing

Translate what the English says. Do not add adjectives, intensifiers, or claims that aren't in the source.

| ✗ Don't | ✓ Do |
|---|---|
| "探索**顶尖**机构为何**选择**以太坊" | "探索领先机构为何在以太坊上构建" |
| "**全球**机构在以太坊上创新" | "机构在以太坊上创新" |
| "稳定币市值的**断层式领先**分布" | "稳定币市值的分布" |
| "以太坊与次席生态的**规模碾压**" | "以太坊与第二大生态系统的对比" |

If the English doesn't say "global," "top-tier," "dominant," or "crushing," the Chinese shouldn't either.

### 2. No Hyperbolic Intensifiers

Avoid stacking dramatic modifiers. One confident adjective is fine; three in a row is not.

**Banned or heavily restricted words/patterns:**

- 极致 (ultimate/extreme) — use sparingly, max 1-2 per page
- 硬核 (hardcore) — do not use
- 无可撼动 (unshakeable) — do not use
- 傲视群雄 (towering above all) — do not use
- 死死 (anchored to death / firmly) — do not use
- 令人窒息 (suffocating/breathtaking) — do not use
- 惊人 (astonishing) — use only when the English itself expresses surprise
- 颠覆式 (disruptive) — only if "disruptive" appears in English
- 引爆 (detonate/ignite) — do not use
- 不可思议 (unbelievable) — do not use
- 断崖式 (cliff-like) — do not use

**Preferred alternatives:**

| Instead of | Use |
|---|---|
| 极致安全 | 安全性 / 高安全性 |
| 极深流动性 | 深厚流动性 |
| 无与伦比的 | 领先的 / 突出的 |
| 全网最深不可测的 | 链上最深厚的 |
| 极度 + anything | Drop "极度", or use 高度 / 充分 |

### 3. No Internet Slang or Colloquialisms

This is an institutional website. The audience is financial professionals, not retail crypto users.

**Do not use:**

- 白嫖 (freeload)
- 套娃 (nesting dolls / recursive)
- 一鱼多吃 (eating one fish multiple ways)
- 拎包入住 (move in bag-in-hand)
- 神器 / 利器 / 尖刀 (divine weapon / sharp blade)
- 狂飙 / 狂欢 (wild surge / carnival)
- 霸主 (hegemon/overlord)
- 画地为牢 (draw a prison on the ground)
- 坐拥 (sit upon / possess grandly)

### 4. No Military or Combat Metaphors

One or two across the entire site is acceptable. A pattern of them is not.

**Avoid:**

- 战火洗礼 (baptism of fire)
- 铁军 (iron army)
- 炮火 (artillery fire)
- 防空洞 (air raid shelter)
- 终极底牌 (ultimate trump card)
- 安保天网 (security skynet)
- 护航舰队 (escort fleet)

**Acceptable alternatives:** 久经考验 (battle-tested) is fine — it's a standard idiom. 实战检验 (field-tested) is fine. Keep it to established idioms, not extended metaphors.

### 5. Preserve Technical Precision

When the English uses distinct technical terms, keep them distinct in Chinese.

| English | ✗ Don't collapse into | ✓ Do preserve as |
|---|---|---|
| "uptime and liveness" | "稳定运行" | "运行时间与网络活性" |
| "credible neutrality" | "可靠性" | "可信中立" |
| "finality" | "确认" | "最终确定性" |
| "data availability" | "数据存储" | "数据可用性" |
